I made a simple Currency Converter project with Java and Swing(for GUI). I added the list of libraries(JAR files) I used in project. If you face with any problem related to JAR files you can download them... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lib(JAR) list:

1 --> json (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/json/json/20230227/) #Download basic json.jar, not javadoc or sources. 

2 --> Flatlaf (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.formdev/flatlaf/3.5.1) (this is for GUI)

I used ExchangeRate-API(https://www.exchangerate-api.com) to get currency data. Site provide you with unique API key when you registered. So you have to create an account and add your own API key in the code to work with it.

Add your API key to this part of the URL...
